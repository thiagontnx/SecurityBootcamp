Preparing For Disaster
######################

Nicely done! In just three days, you managed to protect Blips and Chitz, Inc.'s critical applications using Nutanix best practices, helping prevent or reduce the fallout of a security breach or data loss.

After your daily report to Roy, you being creating a disaster recovery strategy, to get the systems back online after an outage.

For that, you'll be required to configure a consistent protection policy, a DR site, and a backup system that is reliable enough against the ransonware *Krombopulos*.

This will put Nutanix ease of use to the test. It's only a matter of (not much) time until Roy expects the new infrastructure to be production-ready.
