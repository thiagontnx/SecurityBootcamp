"Backups are easy, restoring is hard"?????

Nicely done! In just three days, you managed to protect Blips and Chitz's critical applications using Nutanix best practices, helping prevent or reduce the fallout of a security breach or data loss from now on.

After your daily report to Roy and a quick stop to make fun of people that couldn't beat you in game "A Life Well Lived", because they keep going back to the carpet store, you start your task of creating a strategy to get the systems back up in case of a emergency.

For that, you'll be required to configure a consistent protection policy, a DR site and a backup system that is reliable enough against the Ramsonware Krombopulos variant.

You will put Nutanix ease of use to the test, you don't have much time until Roy comes back asking when the infrastructure will be able GA ready.
