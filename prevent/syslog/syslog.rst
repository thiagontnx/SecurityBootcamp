Configuring a Syslog  (INSTRUCTOR LED)
######################################

The last task in this section is observe the instructor setup a syslog server to collect all the system logs that will be generated by AOS, AHV and Prism. The following are the steps they will demonstrate.

#. Within **Prism Central**, select :fa:`bars` **> Compute & Storage > VMs**. Find the *KiwiSyslog* VM, and note its IP address.

   .. note::

      While you are here, open the console, and then the Kiwi Syslog Service Manager and observe that there is no data collection being performed.

#. Within **Prism Central**, select :fa:`bars` **> Prism Central Settings > Syslog Server**.

#. Click **Add Syslog Server**.

#. Fill out the following fields:

   - **Server Name** - Kiwi
   - **IP Address** - <KIWISYSLOG-IP-ADDRESS>
   - **Port** - 514
   - **Transport Protocol** - UDP

#. Click **Next**.

#. Complete the configuration by selecting which modules and severity level you want to capture. [TODO: Pete: Change this to specific modules and severity for continuity.]

Takeaways:

   - Nutanix is hardened using built-in STIGs which are aligned to NIST SP800-53 guidelines. This alleviates a great deal of labor and cost for our customers, and provides a platform ready to begin deploying workloads much faster.

   - Nutanix nodes are kept in alignment with their secure configuration state throughout their lifecycle. They Self-heal from security deviations, providing assurance to our customers that security wonâ€™t degrade over time.

   - The simplicity of operation is a critical part of the security framework. Complexity is the enemy of execution, and never more so when complexity is centered around security principles. Nutanix simplifies configuration, management, and ongoing operations to provide a simple, elegant, intuitive, and invisible platform.
