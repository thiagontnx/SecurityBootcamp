System Logging

Configuring a Syslog
++++++++++++++++++++

The last task for today is setting up a syslog server to collect all the system logs that will be generated by AOS, AHV and Prism. 

Setting up log forwarding in Prism is super simple but there is often a snag in collection if we don’t appropriately specify the log level or log type that we want to forward. The steps below will walk you through the process.

Because this is a shared environment between you and the rest of the group, and this is a one-time operation per cluster, this should be performed by your instructor and followed as a groups.

#. In **Prism Central**, select :fa:`bars` **> VM Infrastructure > VMs**, search for a VM named KiwiSyslog and copy its IP address.

   .. note::

      You can take this opportunity to check KiwiSyslog VM's console and see that it's not collecting any data yet.

#. In **Prism Central**, select :fa:`bars` **> Prism Central Settings > Syslog Server**.

#. Click **Add Syslog Server**.

#. Fill out the following fields:

   - **Server Name** - Kiwi
   - **IP Address** - Use the IP address from step #1
   - **Port** - 514
   - **Transport Protocol** - UDP

#. Click **Next**.

#. Complete the configuration by selecting which Modules and Severity Level you want to capture.

   .. note:: 
      Note that depending on your selection, it can generate a lot of information being redirected to you Syslog.

#. Click **Save**.

Now, in **Prism Central**, select :fa:`bars` **VM Infrastructure > VMs**, search for a VM named KiwiSyslog and capture its console. You should see logs being collected by our newly-configured Syslog Server.

   -  Takeaways
      - Nutanix is hardened using built-in STIGs which are aligned to NIST SP800-53 guidelines. This alleviates a great deal of labor and cost for our customers and provides a platform ready to begin deploying workloads much faster. 
      - Nutanix nodes are kept in alignment with their secure configuration state throughout their life. They Self-heal from security deviations, providing assurance to our customers that security won’t degrade over time. 
      - The simplicity of operation is a critical part of the security framework. Complexity is the enemy of execution, and never more so when complexity is centered around security principles. Nutanix simplifies configuration, management, and ongoing operations to provide a simple, elegant, intuitive, invisible platform.
