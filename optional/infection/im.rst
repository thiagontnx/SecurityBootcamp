Infection Monkey
+++++++++++++++++

You’re impressed so far, but like the old Russian proverb states, “Trust but verify.” How can you simulate an attack against Blips and Chitz? You don’t have the necessary experience to conduct a penetration test yourself, so you go about trying to find a tool that can simulate an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). 

Infection Monkey, by Guardicore, is a tool that can be used to simulate and automate many of the actions of a penetration test. Obviously, penetration tests by skilled professionals are more thorough and accurate, but for the purposes of trying to expose potential critical vulnerabilities in this new system, it is likely a good tool to use.

   - Takeaways:
      - Microsegmentation offers additional protection against malicious threats that originate from within the data center and spread laterally, from one machine to another.
      - Security policies leverage the text based categories in Prism Central.
      - Flow can restrict traffic on certain ports and protocols for VMs running on AHV.
      - If the policy is created in Monitor mode, it means that the traffic is not blocked until the policy is Enforced. This is helpful to learn the connections and ensure no traffic is blocked unintentionally.
