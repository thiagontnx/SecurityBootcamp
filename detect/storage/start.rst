Monitoring Data Services
------------------------------------------------

Another beautiful day at Blips and Chitz, after just two days you’ve managed to secure the Nutanix Platform basic features by changing all the default passwords and going further into securing mission-critical applications. This feels disconcerting, almost like it can’t be this simple, can it?!

But if it is, you’re ready to start leveraging more tools to help in the Monitoring and Alerting of potentially malicious activity. 

Your buddy, Jerry, who oversees storage and data services has told you that he has deployed a File server and this Nutanix Files product comes with an Analytics dashboard (Files Analytics) that he thinks you’d like to explore as it will store users saved games files and departamental shares of the company. He also mentioned it has a “ransomware” component to it. 

Now, we move on to protecting the data and making sure you have the means to recover and take action upon suspicious activities.
Your impression is that Files Analytics seems to be a very powerful, very useful tool in the effort to detect and prevent Ransomware execution at it’s most likely ingress point, the endpoint. Detecting that activity in the file systems could be critical to the continued smooth running of Blips and Chitz, Inc.
