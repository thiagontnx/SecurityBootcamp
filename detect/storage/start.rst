But if it is, you’re ready to start leveraging more tools to help in the monitoring and alerting of potentially malicious activity.

Jerry, who oversees storage and data services, has told you that he has deployed Nutanix Files, which includes an analytics dashboard. He thinks you’d like to explore this, as it will store users saved games files and departmental shares of the company. He also mentioned it has an *anti-ransomware* component to it. He had your curiosity, but now he has your attention.

We'll now move on to protecting the company's data, and making sure you have the means to recover and take action upon suspicious activities.

On the surface, File Analytics seems to be a very powerful, very useful tool in the effort to detect and prevent ransomware execution at its most likely ingress: the endpoint. Detecting that activity in the file systems could be critical to the continued smooth operation of Blips and Chitz, Inc.
