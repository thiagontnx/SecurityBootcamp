Day Three: Monitoring Data Services
------------------------------------------------

Recap
+++++++++++++

Another beautiful day at Blips and Chitz, after just two days you’ve managed to secure the Nutanix Platform data lane. This feels disconcerting, almost like it can’t be this simple, can it?! 

But if it is, you’re ready to start leveraging more tools to help in the Monitoring and Alerting of potentially malicious activity. 
 
Your buddy, Jerry, who oversees storage and data services has told you that he has deployed a File server and this Nutanix Files product comes with an Analytics dashboard (Files Analytics) that he thinks you’d like to explore as it will store users saved games files and departamental shares of the company. He also mentioned it has a “ransomware” component to it.
