Creating Security Policy
========================

Now that weâ€™ve defined some categories, and assigned them to the respective VMs, we can begin to use those categories to form security policies that will be used to control traffic amongst these VMs. This capability is part of Flow micro-segmentation.

Flow is an application-centric network security product, which is tightly integrated into Nutanix AHV and Prism Central. Flow provides rich network traffic visualization, automation, and security for VMs running on AHV.

Microsegmentation is a component of Flow that uses simple policy-based management to secure VM networking. Using Prism Central categories, you can create a powerful distributed firewall.

#. Within **Prism Central**, select :fa:`bars` **> Network & Security > Security Policies**.

#. Click **Create Security Policy > Secure Applications (App Policy) > Create**.

#. Fill out the following fields, and then click **Next**.

   - **Name** - *USER##*\-FaceRace
   - **Purpose** - Restrict unnecessary access to the FaceRace gaming machines
   - **Secure This App** - Apptype:##-FaceRace

   .. figure:: images/appsec01.png

   .. note::
      If prompted, click *OK, Got it!* on the tutorial diagram of the *Create App Security Policy* wizard.

#. To allow for a more granular configuration of the security policy, click **Set rules on App Tiers, instead**, rather than applying the same rules to all components of the application.

   .. figure:: images/apptierrules.png

#. Select **##-Web** from the drop-down.

#. Select **##-DataBase** from the drop-down.

   .. figure:: images/apptiers.png

   Next, you will define the *Inbounds* rules, which control which sources you will allow to communicate with the FaceRace VMs. You can allow all inbound traffic, or define whitelisted sources. By default, the security policy is set to deny all incoming traffic.

   In this scenario, we will allow inbound TCP traffic to the FaceRace web tier on TCP port 80 from all clients.

#. Under **Inbounds**, click **Add Source**.

#. Fill out the following fields to allow all inbound IP addresses, and then click **Add**.

   - **Add source by:** - Subnet/IP
   - **Enter a subnet.** - 0.0.0.0/0

   .. note::

      Sources can also be specified by category, allowing for greater flexibility as this data can follow a VM regardless of changes to its network location.

#. To create an inbound rule, click **Subnet/IP 0.0.0.0/0**, and then select :fa:`plus-circle` to the left of **AppTier ##-Web**.

#. Choose **Select a Service**, fill out the following fields, and then click **Save**:

   - **Protocol/Service** - TCP
   - **Ports/Service Details** - 80

   .. figure:: images/inbound.png

   .. note::

      Multiple protocols and ports can be added to a single rule.

#. Under **Inbounds**, click :fa:`plus-circle` **Add Source**.

#. Fill out the following fields, and then click **Add**.

   - **Add source by:** - Subnet/IP
   - **Enter a subnet.** - `<PRISM-CENTRAL-IP-ADDRESS>/32` (ex. `10.42.52.39/32`)

   .. note::

      The /32 denotes a single IP address, as opposed to a subnet range.

#. To create an inbound rule, click **Subnet/IP**\ `<PRISM-CENTRAL-IP-ADDRESS>/32`, and then select :fa:`plus-circle` to the left of **AppTier ##-Web**.

#. Choose **Select a Service**, fill out the following fields, and then click **Save**:

   - **Protocol/Service** - TCP
   - **Ports/Service Details** - 22

#. Repeat previous step for **AppTier ##-Database** to allow communication with the database VM.

   .. figure:: images/tierconfig.png

   By default, the security policy allows the application to send all outbound traffic to any destination. The only outbound communication required for your application is to communicate with your DNS server.

#. Under **Outbounds**, select **Allowed List Only** from the drop-down menu, and then click **Add Destination**.

#. Fill out the following fields, and then click **Add**:

   - **Add destination by:** - Subnet/IP (default)
   - **Enter a subnet.** - `<AUTOAD-IP-ADDRESS>/32` (ex. `10.42.52.41/32`)

   .. figure:: images/domainip.png

#. To create an outbounds rule, click **Subnet/IP**\ `<PRISM-CENTRAL-IP-ADDRESS>/32`, and then select :fa:`plus-circle` to the right of **AppTier ##-Web**.

#. Choose **Select a Service**, fill out the following fields, and then click **Save**:

   - **Protocol/Service** - UDP
   - **Ports/Service Details** - 53

#. Repeat this for **AppTier ##-Database**.

   .. figure:: images/tierconfig02.png

	Each tier of the application communicates with other tiers, and as such, the policy must allow this traffic. Some tiers, such as the web tier, do not require communication within the same tier.

#. To define intra-app communication, click **Set Rules within App**.

   .. figure:: images/withinapp.png

#. Click **AppTier ##-Web > Edit**, and under *Can VMs in this tier talk to each other?* select **No** to prevent communication between VMs in this tier.

   There are only two VMs (Prod and Dev) within the tier currently, but scale-out operations will apply this policy to all VMs in this category preventing their ability to communicate with one another - regardless of how many VMs are deployed.

#. While **AppTier:Web** is still selected, click :fa:`plus-circle` to the right of **AppTier ##-Database** to create a tier-to-tier rule.

#. Choose **Select a Service**, fill out the following fields, and then click **Save**:

   - **Protocol/Service** - TCP
   - **Ports/Service Details** - 3306

#. Click **Next** to review the security policy.

#. Click **Save and Monitor** to save the policy.

Testing Security Policy
=======================

Now that we have created our first security policy, we need to test it.
Note that we configured our policy in *Monitor* mode, which means that we are not yet enforcing any inbound and outbound traffic rules.

#. Select :fa:`bars` **> Compute & Storage > VM**.

#. Note the IP address for *USER##*\-Dev-FaceRace-Web, and *USER##*\-Dev-FaceRace-DB.

#. Right-click on *USER##*\-Prod-FaceRace-Web, and then select **Launch Console**.

#. Login using the following credentials:

   - **Username** - centos
   - **Password** - nutanix/4u

#. Start a continuous ping to your *USER##*\-Dev-FaceRace-Web VM IP by entering the command ``ping <USER##-DEV-FACERACE-WEB-IP-ADDRESS>``. Let this run for a few moments to confirm communication, and then cancel it by hitting **CTRL+C**.

#. Note the IP address for *USER##*\-Dev-FaceRace-DB.

#. Right-click on *USER##*\-Prod-FaceRace-DB*, and then select **Launch Console**.

#. Login using the following credentials:

   - **Username** - centos
   - **Password** - nutanix/4u

#. Start a continuous ping to your *USER##*\-Dev-FaceRace-DB VM IP by entering the command ``ping <USER##-DEV-FACERACE-DB-IP-ADDRESS>``. Let this run for a few moments to confirm communication, and then cancel it by hitting **CTRL+C**.

#. To enforce the security policy we created, select :fa:`bars` **> Network & Security > Security Policies**.

#. Click on your *User##-FaceRace* policy. Within your *AppType ##-FaceRace*, hover over the dotted line between the two circles inside *AppTier ##-Web*, and then again for *AppTier ##-Database*. Observe the communication allowed within these application tiers.

   .. figure:: images/webtier.png

   .. figure:: images/dbtier.png

#. Click on the *Discovered* box. Note that Flow is observing the traffic between the VMs in the policy.

   .. figure:: images/monitor1.png
      :align: left

   .. figure:: images/monitor2.png
      :align: right

#. To enforce this security policy, click **Enforce** in the upper right-hand corner.

#. Type **ENFORCE**, and then click **Confirm**.

   .. figure:: images/enforce.png

#. Return to the consoles of *USER##*\-Prod-FaceRace-Web and *USER##*\-Prod-FaceRace-DB.

#. Restart the continuous ping commands in both console windows by hitting the up arrow, followed by enter. You should notice that, while *USER##*\-Prod-FaceRace-Web *cannot* ping *USER##*\-Dev-FaceRace-Web, *USER##*\-Prod-FaceRace-DB *can* ping *USER##*\-Dev-FaceRace-DB.

#. Cancel the ping command in both consoles by hitting CTRL+C, but leave both console windows open.

#. Open a new browser tab and enter <USER##-PROD-FACERACE-WEB-IP-ADDRESS>.

   .. figure:: images/store01.png

#. Select **Stores > Add New Store**.

#. Fill out the information, and then click **Submit**.

   .. figure:: images/store02.png

#. If the store was created, this confirms that your application is working as expected, and that the web tier can communicate with the database tier.

   .. figure:: images/store03.png

#. You may close the store browser tab.

Congratulations! Your security policy is working to restrict the required traffic to the VMs supporting FaceRace app.
